Satya
=====

**Social Authentication Library**

The library is very nascent and in development. It won't compile for sure - so go ahead and work it up.

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, 
`satya` will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
